                      PATH COUNTING (II)
In a country there is a quantum city which is highly developed. It is very much organized. All the places are located at integer coordinate points. There is no place with non integral coordinate points ( remember quantum ). Moreover a person standing at coordinate point (i,j) can only move to points (i,j+1), (i+1,j+1) and (i+1,j).
Now a person is standing at (0,0). Your task is to calculate the number of different paths he can choose to reach (i,j).
Input:
First line contains t, ---> number of test cases.
Next t lines follow each with two integers separated by a space depicting the destination coordinate.
Output:
Print t lines corresponding to each test case. Since the answer might be quite large, print your answer modulus of 1000000007.
Sample input:
